<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan - CossiePlay</h1>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Richard Turner<br>
<strong>Login:</strong> JC260754</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The client, CossiePlay has requested that a website be made to attract more potential cosplayers to the store and monthly parties. The client hopes that the extra customers drawn in by the website will increase the sales that the business is receiving. The website needs to be easily navigable, informative and pleasing to the eye. If the site fulfills these three criteria users won't mind using the site.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p> The client stated that they recieve "about 30 people" to their monthly parties and they sell about 4 costumes per week. By keeping track of these two statistics we can  evaluate whether the website was a success or not. Although it may take some time for the website to spread between cosplayers and have an effect on the statistics.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The client has stated that most of the current cosplayers are in the 35-50 age range. By adding a website I believe it will make the business accessible for any potential cosplayer on the internet. The target audience is anyone who uses the internet and according to <a href="http://www.statista.com/statistics/259828/age-distribution-of-internet-users-in-australia/">statista.com</a> the average age of internet users is fairly evenly spread among all ages. This means we will have to account for all ages when designing the site. The site will feature bold, clear buttons for anyone who is visually impaired. As long as the site follows logical order and has all important elements stand out then users shouldn't have any problems using the site.</p>
