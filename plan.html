<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan - CossiePlay</h1>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Richard Turner<br>
<strong>Login:</strong> JC260754</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The client, CossiePlay has requested that a website be made to attract more potential cosplayers to the store and monthly parties. The client hopes that the extra customers drawn in by the website will increase the sales traffic that the business is receiving. The website needs to be easily navigable, informative and pleasing to the eye. The site will have to meet these three criteria to be a success.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p> The client stated that they recieve "about 30 people" to their monthly parties and they sell about 4 costumes per week. By monitoring changes in these two statistics we can  evaluate whether the website was a success or not. If sales increase then the site has fulfilled it's purpose.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The client has stated that most of the current cosplayers are in the 35-50 age range and would like to expand the audience into teens and young adults. By adding a website Cossieplay may bridge the gap and connect with a younger audience.According to <a href="http://www.statista.com/statistics/259828/age-distribution-of-internet-users-in-australia/">statista.com</a> 15-34 year olds make up 35% of internet users which means the website should have a high impact among a younger age group. I would highly reccommend that the client get involved in social media as it would boost sales with the target age group.</p>
